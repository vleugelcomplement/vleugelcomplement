Hi there, 

This account is primary for some "social" activity: issues, pull requests etc. If you came here looking for a repo that used to be there, but now isn't, check my [codeberg account](https://codeberg.org/vleugelcomplement) or email me directly: having bits of myself sold inside a Frankensteinian product of some obsure copyrights-violating NN was never my plan.

It is obviosly a sad state of affairs; but, well, thanks for the ride, octocat; that one that used to be less ghosty.
